OOP Projects

This repository contains C++ Object-Oriented Programming projects, each representing a separate lab.
Every project demonstrates a specific OOP concept: classes, inheritance, operator overloading, templates, exceptions, dynamic arrays, specializations, and logging.

Below is a full list of the labs included in this collection:

1. lab01_student-records-manager

Console system for managing student records (CRUD), including file I/O, sorting, and structured output.

2. lab02_time-logger

Custom Time class with automatic normalization and a Singleton Logger that records all object states.

3. lab03_dish-nutrition-calculator

Dish class implementing constructors, destructors, input validation, and energy calculation based on macros.

4. lab04_vector-operations

3D vector class with operator overloading (+, *=, prefix/postfix ++) and coordinate manipulation.

5. lab05_employee-staff-management

Two interacting classes: Employee and Staff, featuring operator overloading, dynamic memory, and salary updates.

6. lab07_pair-rational-arithmetic

Arithmetic with pairs and rational numbers using inheritance and operator overloading.

7. lab09_dynamic-array-vector-exceptions

Dynamic array of vectors with std::vector, custom exception classes, safe indexing, and array resizing.

8. lab10_template-array-vector-specializations

Fully templated Array<T> and Vector<T> with complete specializations for string and bool.

9. lab10_templates-array-vector-polymorphic-input

Advanced template system with polymorphic input, JSON-style printing (string specialization), and boolean vector formatting.
